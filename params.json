{"name":"KFoundation","tagline":"Cross-Platform General-Purposed Foundation for Modern C++ Programming","body":"# The KFoundation Story\r\n\r\nKFoundation is a made by Kay, a programmer who used to program in C++ a long time ago, but lived most of his life in the harmonious world of Java, and the well-organized Foundation framework of Objective-C. He finds himself again in the world of C++ that even with new revisions as C++11 etc. looks old and backwards, and unnecessarily complicated. BOOST library didn't help because it leaves an extensive footprint on the compiled code. He wanted something small, elegant, yet highly capable, fast and modern. And so, the KFoundation was born.\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n* Portable\r\n  * Cross-platform\r\n  * Backwards compatible with any compiler down to C++98\r\n  * Fixed-sized data types\r\n* Managed Pointers\r\n  * Simple and elegant API\r\n  * Automatic reference counted memory management\r\n  * Novel fast and sage algorithm\r\n  * Supports both heap- and pool-allocated objects\r\n* System class (as in java.System class)\r\n* Exceptions with human/machine-readable stack trace\r\n* I/O Stream\r\n  * Elegant API design\r\n  * Extended variations of IO streams: File, Buffer, String, Internet, ...\r\n  * Supplemented with a versatile parser utility\r\n* Multithreading\r\n* Managed containers (array) and type wrappers\r\n* Novel object serialization/deserialization API to/from XML, JSON, etc.\r\n  * Perfect for RESTful applications\r\n  * Valuable tool for debugging your objects\r\n  * Feed your objects directly to IO streams and logger. No need for operator overloading.\r\n* Region arithmetics\r\n* Multi-channel Multi-level Logger\r\n  * LOG << \"Logging had never been so easy!!! \" << mySerializableObject << EL\r\n\r\n\r\n# Want to Get It?\r\n\r\nThe best way to get KFoundation is by cloning its git repository to your local machine.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$git clone https:://github.com/hkhandan/kfoundation.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can download the latest release from https://github.com/hkhandan/kfoundation/releases page.\r\n\r\nTo install you need\r\n* CMake 3.0 or above\r\n* A Compatible C++98 or above compiler (gcc or clang would do)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$cd kfoundation\r\n$mkdir build\r\n$cd build\r\n$cmake ..\r\n$make\r\n$sudo make install\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\n\r\nIf you found a bug, have a comment, or want to ask for new features, try the following page:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hkhandan/kfoundation/issues\r\n\r\nTo contact the author (replace '@' with '.' and vice versa):\r\n\r\nhamed@khandan.port@kobe-u@ac@jp\r\n\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgement\r\nThe KFoundation project is done at [RIKEN Advanced Institute for Computational Science](http://www.aics.riken.jp/jp/), under K-Computer Project fund.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
