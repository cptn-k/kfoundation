{"name":"KFoundation","tagline":"Cross-Platform General-Purposed Foundation for Modern C++ Programming","body":"KFoundation is a collection of modern C++ APIs that replace some standard C++ APIs with better alternatives, and adds some more. These APIs include:\r\n\r\n* Automatic memory management with flat time-complexity performance, and enhanced stability and debugging features; \r\n* Object serialization/deserialization API that turns enabled objects to and from XML, JSON, etc.;\r\n* Broad range of I/O streams including network I/O; \r\n* Multi-level multi-channel logger;\r\n* Exceptions with printable/serializable stack trace;\r\n* Range Arithmetic for facilitation of distributed stencil computation,\r\n* Thread, Mutex, Condition and Java-like System classes.\r\n\r\nKFoundation is cross-platform and compatible with standard C++98 up to C++11 compilers.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Want to Know More?\r\n\r\n* Take a look at the [README.TXT file](https://github.com/hkhandan/kfoundation/blob/master/README.TXT)\r\n\r\n* See the [documentation page](http://hkhandan.github.io/kfoundation/doc/index.html) for a full list of features or to brows API documentation. \r\n\r\n* Or, download the entire documentation in [one PDF file](http://hkhandan.github.io/kfoundation/refman.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Want to Get It?\r\n\r\nThe best way to get KFoundation is by cloning its git repository to your local machine.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$git clone https:://github.com/hkhandan/kfoundation.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can download the latest release from https://github.com/hkhandan/kfoundation/releases page.\r\n\r\nTo install you need\r\n* CMake 3.0 or above\r\n* A Compatible C++98 or above compiler (gcc or clang would do)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$cd kfoundation\r\n$mkdir build\r\n$cd build\r\n$cmake ..\r\n$make\r\n$sudo make install\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\n\r\nIf you found a bug, have a comment, or want to ask for new features, try the following page:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hkhandan/kfoundation/issues\r\n\r\nTo contact the author (replace '@' with '.' and vice versa):\r\n\r\nhamed@khandan.port@kobe-u@ac@jp\r\n\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgement\r\nThe KFoundation project is done at [RIKEN Advanced Institute for Computational Science](http://www.aics.riken.jp/jp/), under K-Computer Project fund.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
