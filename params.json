{"name":"KFoundation","tagline":"Cross-Platform General-Purposed Foundation for Modern C++ Programming","body":"### The KFoundation Story\r\nKFoundation is a made by Kay, a programmer who used to program in C++ a long time ago, but lived most of his life in the harmonious world of Java, and the well-organized Foundation framework of Objective-C. He finds himself again in the world of C++ that now looks old and backwards, and unnecessarily complicated. BOOST library didn't help because it leaves an extensive footprint on the compiled code. He wanted something small, elegant, yet highly capable, fast and modern. And so, the KFoundation was born.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* Portable\r\n** Cross-platform\r\n** Backwards compatible with any compiler down to C++98\r\n** Fixed-sized data types\r\n* Managed Pointers\r\n** Fastest, safest and most elegant smart pointer implementation to date.\r\n** Automatic reference counted memory management\r\n** Supports both heap- and pool-allocated objects\r\n* System class (as in java.System class)\r\n* Exceptions with human/machine-readable stack trace\r\n* I/O Stream\r\n** Elegant renewed IO Stream API design\r\n** Extended variations of IO streams: File, Buffer, String, Internet, ...\r\n** Supplemented with a versatile parser utility\r\n* Multithreading\r\n* Managed containers (array) and type wrappers\r\n* Novel extensible object serialization/deserialization API to/from XML, JSON, etc.\r\n** Perfect for RESTful applications\r\n** Valuable tool for debugging your objects\r\n* Region arithmetics\r\n* Multi-channel Multi-level Logger\r\n** LOG << \"Logging have never been so easy!!!\" << EL\r\n\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
